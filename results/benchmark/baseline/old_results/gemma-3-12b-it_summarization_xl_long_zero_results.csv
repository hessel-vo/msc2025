99,c,"Sets the active LIN schedule table by index, first validating the index and then using a semaphore to thread-safely update the scheduler's state and reset its entry pointer to the start of the new table","The function `abstract_lin_scheduler_set_active_table` activates a specified table within a LIN scheduler, ensuring exclusive access via a semaphore and resetting the entry index to the beginning of the table."
100,c,"Disables a LIN scheduler by first checking if it's already stopped, then taking a semaphore to safely wait for the current operation to complete before setting the active schedule table index to -1","This C code disables a Linear Network (LIN) scheduler by marking it as stopped and acquiring a semaphore to ensure exclusive access, handling the case where the scheduler is already stopped."
