Your task is to create a C function based on a summary.

**[Target]**
**Based on the summary below, generate the full C function, including the function signature and function body (do not provide any other output)**

**Summary:**
"Enables or disables a specific GPIO output on a high-voltage shield by validating the pin index (0-31), remapping it via a nibble-swap, modifying a cached register bit, and then calling a helper function to write the update to the hardware."

**Code:**
```c
static int hvs_set_gpio_output_enable(const struct device* dev, uint8_t index, bool enable) {
```
