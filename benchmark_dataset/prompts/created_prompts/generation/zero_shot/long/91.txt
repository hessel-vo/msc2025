Your task is to implement a C function based on a summary.

**[Target]**
**Use the summary below to generate the related C function**
Return the full function code, including function signature and function implementation
Do NOT add comments to the code and provide only the code as output

**Summary:**
"Enables or disables a specific GPIO output on a high-voltage shield by validating the pin index (0-31), remapping it via a nibble-swap, modifying a cached register bit, and then calling a helper function to write the update to the hardware"

**Code:**
static int hvs_set_gpio_output_enable(const struct device* dev, uint8_t index, bool enable) {
