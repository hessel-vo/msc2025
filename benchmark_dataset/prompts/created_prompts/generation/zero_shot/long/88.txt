Your task is to create a C function based on a summary.

**[Target]**
**Based on the summary below, generate the full C function, including the function signature and function body (do not provide any other output)**

**Summary:**
"Acts as a LIN-to-CAN gateway callback, translating an incoming LIN frame by using its first data byte's top two bits as an index to find a target CAN ID, constructing a new CAN frame with the translated ID and a payload where those index bits are masked out, and finally invoking a registered handler with the resulting CAN frame"

**Code:**
```c
static void lin_incoming_cb(const struct lin_frame *frame, void *user_data) {
```
