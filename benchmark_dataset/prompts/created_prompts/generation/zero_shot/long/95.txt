Your task is to create a C function based on a summary.

**[Target]**
**Based on the summary below, generate the full C function, including the function signature and function body (do not provide any other output)**

**Summary:**
"Iterates through a pre-configured list of low-voltage GPIOs, setting the state of each pin enabled by an input mask to the corresponding bit in a value word, logging and returning an error if any underlying GPIO operation fails"

**Code:**
```c
static int hvs_set_masked_raw(const struct device* port, gpio_port_pins_t mask, gpio_port_value_t value) {
```
