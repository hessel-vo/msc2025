Your task is to implement a Cpp function based on a summary.
Below is an example of generating a Cpp function from a summary.

---

**[Example]**
**Summary:**
"Maximum sum such that no two elements are adjacent‚Äù

**Code:**
int FindMaxSum(vector<int> arr, int n) {
    int incl = arr[0];
    int excl = 0;
    int excl_new;
    int i;

    for (i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        excl_new = (incl > excl) ? incl : excl;
        incl = excl + arr[i];
        excl = excl_new;
    }

    return ((incl > excl) ? incl : excl);
}

**[Target]**
**Use the summary below to generate the related Cpp function**
Return the full function code, including function signature and function implementation
Do NOT add comments to the code and provide only the code as output

**Summary:**
"For an active connection, adds a thread to a list to be joined on exit, avoiding duplicates"

**Code:**
void joinOnExit(std::uintptr_t conn, std::thread & t) {
