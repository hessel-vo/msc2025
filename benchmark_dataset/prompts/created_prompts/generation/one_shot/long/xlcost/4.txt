Your task is to implement a Python function based on a summary.
Below is an example of generating a Python function from a summary.

---

**[Example]**
**Summary:**
"Finds the maximum sum of a subsequence of non-adjacent elements by iteratively tracking the maximum sum including and excluding the current element”

**Code:**
def find_max_sum(arr):
    incl = 0
    excl = 0
    for i in arr:
        new_excl = excl if excl > incl else incl
        incl = excl + i
        excl = new_excl
    return excl if excl > incl else incl

**[Target]**
**Use the summary below to generate the related Python function**
Return the full target function code, including function signature and function implementation
Do NOT add comments to the code and provide only the code as output

**Summary:**
"Returns the type definition tuple from a class-level list of types that matches the provided 'datatype' name, or returns None if no match is found"

**Code:**
def get_type(cls, datatype: str) -> tuple[str, Callable, list[str]] | None:
