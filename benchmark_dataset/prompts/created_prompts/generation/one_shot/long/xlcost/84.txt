Your task is to create a C function based on a summary.
Below is an example of generating a C function from a summary.

---

**[Example]**
**Summary:**
"Finds the maximum sum of a subsequence of non-adjacent elements by iteratively tracking the maximum sum including and excluding the current element”

**Code:**
```c
int FindMaxSum(int arr[], int n) {
    int incl = arr[0];
    int excl = 0;
    int excl_new;
    int i;

    for (i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        excl_new = (incl > excl) ? incl : excl;
        incl = excl + arr[i];
        excl = excl_new;
    }

    return ((incl > excl) ? incl : excl);
}
```

**[Target]**
**Based on the summary below, generate the full C function, including the function signature and function body (do not provide any other output)**

**Summary:**
"Maps a raw integer gain value (1, 2, 4, 8, or 16) to its corresponding `hv_shield_dac_gains_t` enum representation, returning 0 on success or an `-ENOTSUP` error code for any unsupported input"

**Code:**
```c
static int hvs_dac_convert_gain(int raw_gain, enum hv_shield_dac_gains_t* gain) {
```
