Your task is to implement a C function based on a summary.
Below is an example of generating a C function from a summary.

---

**[Example]**
**Summary:**
"Finds the maximum sum of a subsequence of non-adjacent elements by iteratively tracking the maximum sum including and excluding the current element‚Äù

**Code:**
int FindMaxSum(int arr[], int n) {
    int incl = arr[0];
    int excl = 0;
    int excl_new;
    int i;

    for (i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        excl_new = (incl > excl) ? incl : excl;
        incl = excl + arr[i];
        excl = excl_new;
    }

    return ((incl > excl) ? incl : excl);
}

**[Target]**
**Use the summary below to generate the related C function**
Return the full target function code, including function signature and function implementation
Do NOT add comments to the code and provide only the code as output

**Summary:**
"Sets the gain for a specified DAC (0 or 1) on a high-voltage shield by updating its value in a cached data structure and then calling an update function to write the new configuration to the hardware, returning an error for an invalid DAC index"

**Code:**
static int hvs_set_dac_gain(const struct device* dev, uint8_t dac, enum hv_shield_dac_gains_t gain) {
