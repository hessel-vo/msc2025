Your task is to create a Python function based on a summary.
Below is an example of generating a Python function from a summary.

---

**[Example]**
**Summary:**
"Finds the maximum sum of a subsequence of non-adjacent elements by iteratively tracking the maximum sum including and excluding the current element”

**Code:**
```python
def find_max_sum(arr):
    incl = 0
    excl = 0
    for i in arr:
        new_excl = excl if excl > incl else incl
        incl = excl + i
        excl = new_excl
    return excl if excl > incl else incl
```

**[Target]**
**Based on the summary below, generate the full Python function, including the function signature and function body (do not provide any other output)**

**Summary:**
"Calculates a 32-bit FNV-1 hash for a given byte string by iterating through each byte, multiplying the current hash by the FNV prime, and then performing a bitwise XOR with the byte."

**Code:**
```python
def fnv1_32_hash(identifier: bytes) -> int:
```
