Your task is to create a C function based on a summary.
Below is an example of generating a C function from a summary.

---

**[Example]**
**Summary:**
"Finds the maximum sum of a subsequence of non-adjacent elements by iteratively tracking the maximum sum including and excluding the current element”

**Code:**
```c
int FindMaxSum(int arr[], int n) {
    int incl = arr[0];
    int excl = 0;
    int excl_new;
    int i;

    for (i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        excl_new = (incl > excl) ? incl : excl;
        incl = excl + arr[i];
        excl = excl_new;
    }

    return ((incl > excl) ? incl : excl);
}
```

**[Target]**
**Based on the summary below, generate the full C function, including the function signature and function body (do not provide any other output)**

**Summary:**
"Acts as a LIN-to-CAN gateway callback, translating an incoming LIN frame by using its first data byte's top two bits as an index to find a target CAN ID, constructing a new CAN frame with the translated ID and a payload where those index bits are masked out, and finally invoking a registered handler with the resulting CAN frame."

**Code:**
```c
static void lin_incoming_cb(const struct lin_frame *frame, void *user_data) {
```
