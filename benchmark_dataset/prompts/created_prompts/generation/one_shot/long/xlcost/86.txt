Your task is to implement a C function based on a summary.
Below is an example of generating a C function from a summary.

---

**[Example]**
**Summary:**
"Finds the maximum sum of a subsequence of non-adjacent elements by iteratively tracking the maximum sum including and excluding the current element‚Äù

**Code:**
int FindMaxSum(int arr[], int n) {
    int incl = arr[0];
    int excl = 0;
    int excl_new;
    int i;

    for (i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        excl_new = (incl > excl) ? incl : excl;
        incl = excl + arr[i];
        excl = excl_new;
    }

    return ((incl > excl) ? incl : excl);
}

**[Target]**
**Use the summary below to generate the related C function**
Return the full function code, including function signature and function implementation
Do NOT add comments to the code and provide only the code as output

**Summary:**
"Disables a specific LIN-to-CAN receive filter by clearing its callback pointer, or disables all filters if a special ID is passed, while ignoring out-of-bounds IDs"

**Code:**
static void lin2can_remove_rx_filter(const struct device *dev, int filter_id) {
