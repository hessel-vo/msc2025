Your task is to implement a Python function based on a summary.
Below is an example of generating a Python function from a summary.

---

**[Example]**
**Summary:**
"Finds the maximum sum of a subsequence of non-adjacent elements by iteratively tracking the maximum sum including and excluding the current element”

**Code:**
def find_max_sum(arr):
    incl = 0
    excl = 0
    for i in arr:
        new_excl = excl if excl > incl else incl
        incl = excl + i
        excl = new_excl
    return excl if excl > incl else incl

**[Target]**
**Use the summary below to generate the related Python function**
Return the full function code, including function signature and function implementation
Do NOT add comments to the code and provide only the code as output

**Summary:**
"Loads and parses multiple VSpec files from specified paths, using a list of include directories, then merges them into a single composite VSpec object and returns it, raising an exception if no files are successfully loaded"

**Code:**
def load_vspec(include_dirs: list[Path], specs: list[Path], identifier: str | None = None) -> VSpec:
