Your task is to implement a Python function based on a summary.
Below is an example of generating a Python function from a summary.

---

**[Example]**
**Summary:**
"Finds the maximum sum of a subsequence of non-adjacent elements by iteratively tracking the maximum sum including and excluding the current element”

**Code:**
def find_max_sum(arr):
    incl = 0
    excl = 0
    for i in arr:
        new_excl = excl if excl > incl else incl
        incl = excl + i
        excl = new_excl
    return excl if excl > incl else incl

**[Target]**
**Use the summary below to generate the related Python function**
Return the full target function code, including function signature and function implementation
Do NOT add comments to the code and provide only the code as output

**Summary:**
"Recursively traverses a VSS node tree to populate a dictionary with the occurrence count and a list of fully qualified paths for each unique node name"

**Code:**
def populate_unique_node_names(node_names_dict: dict[str, Any], vss_node: VSSNode) -> None:
