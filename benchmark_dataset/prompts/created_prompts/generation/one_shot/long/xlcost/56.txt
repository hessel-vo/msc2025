Your task is to create a Cpp function based on a summary.
Below is an example of generating a Cpp function from a summary.

---

**[Example]**
**Summary:**
"Finds the maximum sum of a subsequence of non-adjacent elements by iteratively tracking the maximum sum including and excluding the current element‚Äù

**Code:**
```cpp
int FindMaxSum(vector<int> arr, int n) {
    int incl = arr[0];
    int excl = 0;
    int excl_new;
    int i;

    for (i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        excl_new = (incl > excl) ? incl : excl;
        incl = excl + arr[i];
        excl = excl_new;
    }

    return ((incl > excl) ? incl : excl);
}
```

**[Target]**
**Based on the summary below, generate the full Cpp function, including the function signature and function body (do not provide any other output)**

**Summary:**
"A callback function that handles the removal of a D-Bus watch by stopping its monitoring and disassociating the high-level wrapper object from the underlying `libdbus` watch"

**Code:**
```cpp
void DBusConnection::onRemoveWatch(::DBusWatch* libdbusWatch, void* data) {
```
