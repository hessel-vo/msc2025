Your task is to create a Python function based on a summary.
Below is an example of generating a Python function from a summary.

---

**[Example]**
**Summary:**
"Finds the maximum sum of a subsequence of non-adjacent elements by iteratively tracking the maximum sum including and excluding the current element”

**Code:**
```python
def find_max_sum(arr):
    incl = 0
    excl = 0
    for i in arr:
        new_excl = excl if excl > incl else incl
        incl = excl + i
        excl = new_excl
    return excl if excl > incl else incl
```

**[Target]**
**Based on the summary below, generate the full Python function, including the function signature and function body (do not provide any other output)**

**Summary:**
"Parses a type string to create an `ApiGearType` object, mapping common primitive types to their ApiGear equivalents, sanitizing custom type names by replacing dots with underscores, and setting an array flag based on a "[]" suffix."

**Code:**
```python
def get_apigear_datatype(t: str) -> typing.Optional[ApiGearType]:
```
